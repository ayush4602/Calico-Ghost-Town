# About:
There would be a wrecked horror site, with dim lights and horror sound, with skulls and bones spread around, with ghosts roaming around in the air, and with dynamic zombies on the land approaching the main player which who will have a weapon with limited bullets. The zombies would be attacking our main player and our ultimate goal would be to finish the level by killing the main king zombie. To reach the king zombie, our player would have to face hurdles with zombies and somehow managing and escaping to reach the final destination where the king lives. we have to go about reaching the king zombie and kill him. The zombies would be in their area and would get triggered to follow the player if he comes into their area.
